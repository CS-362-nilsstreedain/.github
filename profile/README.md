The objective of this course is to introduce a limited number of concepts and practices related to software project management, software testing processes and quality management.

When the students complete the course, they will:
- know the principal tasks of software project managers;
- have been introduced to the notion of risk management and some of the risks that can arise in software projects;
- understand factors that influence personal motivation and what these might mean for software project managers;
- understand key issues that influence team working, such as team composition, organization, and communication.
- understand the stages of testing from testing during development to acceptance testing by system customers;
- have been introduced to techniques that help you choose test cases that are geared to discovering program defects;
- understand test-first development, where you design tests before writing code and run these tests automatically;
- know about three distinct types of testing—component testing, system testing, and release testing;
- understand the distinctions between development testing and user testing.
- have been introduced to the quality management process and know why quality planning is important;
- be aware of the importance of standards in the quality management process and know how standards are used in quality assurance;
- understand how reviews and inspections are used as a mechanism for software quality assurance;
- understand how quality management in agile methods is based on the development of a team quality culture;
- understand how measurement may be helpful in assessing some software quality.

## Assignments and Grading
### Assignments
There are four total assignments to be completed over the course of this class. Assignments might include a mixture of written documents, drawings, and code submissions. You'll have about a week to complete one assignment.

### Midterm Exam
There is one midterm exam for this course. The test is take-home and is open everything except other students. It will not be conducted in person, will not be proctored, and no lecture will be given on or near the day it's assigned. You'll have about a week to complete it.

### Final Exam
The final is in the same format as the midterm exam.

### Grading Details
There won't be a curve applied to the grading of this course, nor is there any rounding or weighting of assignments and/or the final. The points you see in the assignments are the points available, including in the table below. The grading scale is as follows, and will be adhered to strictly (I have already taken into account some pretty generous rounding), so please don't ask for "just a few more points":

- 91.5 ≤ A ≤ 100
- 89.5 ≤ A- < 91.5
- 87.5 ≤ B+ < 89.5
- 81.5 ≤ B < 87.5
- 79.5 ≤ B- < 81.5
- 77.5 ≤ C+ < 79.5
- 71.5 ≤ C < 77.5
- 69.5 ≤ C- < 71.5
- 67.5 ≤ D+ < 69.5
- 61.5 ≤ D < 67.5
- 59.5 ≤ D- < 61.5
- 0 ≤ F < 59.5

In programming assignments, any crashes, hangs, errors, infinite loops, etc. not covered in the grading instructions will cause your program to lose points, despite the rubric. The amount lost depends on the severity, how much it affects the rest of the program, and how it is recovered from, if at all, all based on the discretion of the grader.

If you believe a grade returned to you is incorrect, please submit proof to your grader within 48 hours of the grade being received by you. Your proof must consist of screenshots (not a copy/paste of the text) that clearly show things working on your end. Your screenshots must show the places where the grading has been done incorrectly on our end, if any, and this grading must be done on the submission that you have made (i.e., redownload it yourself from Canvas to make these screenshots). If you don't provide proof, or if you ask for a regrade past 48 hours of the grade being given, a regrade won't be done.

### Late Assignments
The late work policy is lenient for this course. Each day your assignment is late its grade will be reduced by 10%. Maximum of 4 days late, afterwards the grade is zero.

If there is a planned exculpatory reason as to why your assignment will be late (e.g., job interview with travel, etc.), you must contact the instructor via email at least 48 hours before the assignment due date. Otherwise, no extensions will be given. Unacceptable reasons for late extensions include being busy in other classes and data loss—make backups of your work. Emergencies, sickness, etc. are exempt from the 48-hour rule.

## Course Expectations and Policies
You can expect me:
- To start and end class on time.
- To assign homework that adequately covers the material and meets the learning objectives of the course while adhering to the time expectations.
- To give exams that accurately reflect the material covered in class and assigned in homework.

I can expect you:
- To know and abide by the rules in this syllabus.
- To attend class.
- To be attentive and engaged in class.
- To spend an adequate amount of time on the homework each week.
- To engage with both the abstract and computational sides of the material.
- To be curious.
- To seek help when appropriate, early and often.

### Study Time Expectation
According to OSU Catalog, one credit is generally given for three hours per week of work in and out of class. Each hour of class lecture is therefore expected to require two hours of work outside of class. Since CS 362 is a 4-credit course, students should expect to spend, on average, about 12 hours per week inclusive of in-class and out-of-class activities. It may take more than twelve hours per week to excel in this course.

### Attendance Policy
Regular and punctual attendance is expected and is the student’s responsibility. A good engineer upholds professional conduct by being prompt. If this is not your habit, acquire it. It will help you in this class and in your career.

### Sick Policy
Students should not attend class or any public gatherings while ill with COVID-19, influenza, or any other contagion. Students with symptoms will be asked to leave the classroom or instructor’s office and return home for recovery. If you have COVID-19, influenza, or another virus or contagion, the illness and self-isolation period may be two weeks or longer. Most students should be able to complete a successful term despite such an absence. Students who are absent because of illness will be provided with a reasonable opportunity to make up missed work. Ordinarily, it is inappropriate to substitute for the missed assignment the weighting of a term's work that does not include the missed assignment or exam. Completion of all assignments and exams assures the greatest chance for students to develop heightened understanding and content mastery that is unavailable through the weighting process. The opportunity to complete all assignments and exams is intended to enable students to make responsible situational decisions, including the decision to avoid spreading a contagion to other students, staff, and faculty, without in any way endangering their academic opportunities and work. Students with a contagion do not need to provide a physician's certification of illness. Ill students should inform the teaching staff via email or through Canvas (but not through personal contact) as soon as possible that they will be absent because of an illness. The teaching staff will work with them to arrange to make up missed assignments or exams. The above considerations also apply if students are caring for someone that is ill. The Office of the Dean of Students can assist students if they are navigating a range of extenuating life circumstances including but not limited to prolonged illness, hospitalization, and financial concerns. They can be reached Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM by calling 541-737-8748 or emailing support.odos@oregonstate.edu.

### Emergencies
In the event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to change as may be necessitated by a revised term calendar or other circumstances. Email and Canvas will be used to provide information about changes in this course. Please review posted guides on emergency responses and emergency alert communication, and sign up for emergency alerts, at http://emergency.oregonstate.edu/.  

### Student Conduct Expectations
The Student Conduct Code establishes community standards and procedures necessary to maintain and protect an environment conducive to learning, in keeping with the educational objectives of Oregon State University. This code is based on the assumption that all persons must treat one another with dignity and respect in order for scholarship to thrive. Students are expected to abide by OSU’s Code of Student Conduct, which they are encouraged to read at https://beav.es/codeofconduct Links to an external site..

Professionalism in this course is as important as in the workplace and included such traits as preparation, productivity, and promptness. Cell phones, email, texting, and all other potential distractions will not be tolerated during regularly scheduled class meetings or during office hours.

## Course Statements
### Academic Calendar
All students are subject to the registration and refund deadlines as stated in the Academic Calendar: https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/osu-academic-calendar

### Statement Regarding Students with Disabilities
Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations."

### Student Bill of Rights
OSU has twelve established student rights. They include due process in all university disciplinary processes, an equal opportunity to learn, and grading in accordance with the course syllabus: https://asosu.oregonstate.edu/advocacy/rights Links to an external site.

### Reach Out for Success
University students encounter setbacks from time to time. If you encounter difficulties and need assistance, it’s important to reach out. Consider discussing the situation with an instructor or academic advisor. Learn about resources that assist with wellness and academic success at oregonstate.edu/ReachOut. If you are in immediate crisis, please contact the Crisis Text Line by texting OREGON to 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255)

### Student Evaluation of Courses
During Fall, Winter, and Spring term the online Student Learning Experience surveys open to students the Wednesday of week 9 and close the Sunday before Finals Week. Students will receive notification, instructions and the link through their ONID email. They may also log into the system via MyOregonState or directly at beaves.es/Student-Learning-Survey Links to an external site.. Survey results are extremely important and are used to help improve courses and the learning experience of future students. Responses are anonymous (unless a student chooses to “sign” their comments, agreeing to relinquish anonymity of written comments) and are not available to instructors until after grades have been posted. The results of scaled questions and signed comments go to both the instructor and their unit head/supervisor. Anonymous (unsigned) comments go to the instructor only.
